## Control the commercial and financial context

A quote in Cord is not just a document; it's a **smart collection engine**. In the right side panel of the quoter, you will find advanced options where you decide exactly *how* and *when* your client pays you.

### 1. Payment Terms and Advances

Unlike static quoters, Cord understands the reality of B2B where 100% upfront is rarely charged:

- **Cash (Advance + Balance):** You can request a percentage as an advance (e.g., *50%*). Upon quote approval, the system automatically splits the charge: the client will see a button to immediately pay the advance amount, and the remaining balance will be pending based on the agreed date.
- **Credit (Net 30 / Net 60):** If you grant corporate credit, the immediate payment button will be hidden. The client will see a message confirming their order with 30 or 60-day credit. Payment will be automatically enabled when the due date is reached.

### 2. Recurring Payments (Subscriptions / Retainers)

If you are an agency, consultancy, or sell continuous services, you can turn any quote into an **Automatic Monthly Retainer**.
- By activating the "Monthly recurring charge" option, the quote changes its behavior and integrates with Stripe Subscriptions.
- The client will authorize their credit/debit card **only once** from the public link when approving the proposal.
- From that moment on, the system will automatically charge the total amount every month and the money will drop directly into your bank account friction-free, automatically generating the CFDI 4.0 invoice each cycle.

### 3. Currencies and Exchange Rate Coverage (FX Lock)

- **Quoting vs Billing Currency:** In B2B, it's common to quote in Dollars (USD) or Euros (EUR) to protect against devaluation, but bill in Mexican Pesos (MXN). Cord solves this natively.
- **FX Lock (Frozen rate for 30 days):** When creating a quote in USD/EUR, Cord fetches the spot interbank rate (or Banxico FIX, depending on your setup). The system allows you to apply a coverage *buffer* percentage to protect your margins. Once the quote is sent, Cord **freezes this rate (FX Lock) for up to 30 days**. If the peso moves tomorrow, your client will pay in MXN using the rate that was locked, thus protecting the commercial relationship and your profits.
- **Validity:** Set the commercial validity days. If the quote expires, the Magic Link will block approval.

### 4. Notes and Legal Terms

- **Terms and Conditions:** Space for cancellation policies, delivery times, or warranties. This text accompanies the client in both the interactive web view and the final PDF.
