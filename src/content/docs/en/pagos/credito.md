## B2B Credit and the public link

In corporate B2B sales, it is very common that the client does not pay on the same day they approve the quote, but rather negotiates a credit term of 30, 60, or 90 days (Net 30/60).

When you select a credit term in Cord, the system **intelligently blocks the ability to pay upfront** so as not to confuse the client or violate their corporate accounts payable policies.

### The credit approval flow

1. You send the quote with "Net 30" terms.
2. The client opens the link. Instead of a button that says "Approve and Pay", they will see a button that simply says **"Approve document"**.
3. Upon approval, no card or SPEI form is displayed. Instead, the system shows a success message: **"Order confirmed with Net 30 credit — due on [Calculated Date]"**.
4. That's it! The quote switches to "Approved" status and you can deliver the service or product.

## Automatic payment enablement

Cord calculates the due date by adding the credit days to the exact date the client approved the document.

Once the due date arrives:
1. The public link of the quote **automatically mutates**.
2. The "credit" message disappears and in its place, the payment component (Card and SPEI) is revealed.
3. If you have the Artificial Intelligence Collection Agent activated (available on Scale and Developer plans), the system will detect that the credit has expired and will send an automatic, polite email to the client, including the payment link which is now active for collection.

This native logic in Cord prevents a corporate client from rejecting your quote out of fear of seeing a credit card form on day 1, guaranteeing that the payment collection is enabled exactly on time.
