## The Wizard: Complete Financial Plan

Building a master budget from scratch can be intimidating. That's why Cord includes a **Financial Plan Wizard** that generates the "universal cash waterfall" with a single click.

When you launch the Wizard (from the sidebar > **Budgets > Create Full Plan**), the system will:
1. Analyze your Stripe history (the last 6 months).
2. Automatically seed a **Sales Schedule** using your actual average sales as a baseline projection.
3. Create a **Collections Schedule** connected to your sales, assuming a standard collection policy (e.g., 40% same month, 30% next month, 30% at 60 days).
4. Create a **Cash Flow Schedule** that automatically receives the inflows from the collections schedule.

Optionally, if you check the *"Include Production"* box, the Wizard will also generate the Production and Raw Material Inventory schedules connected to your projected sales.

## Cord's 7 Templates

If you prefer to create individual schedules, Cord offers 7 templates with pre-wired rows and mathematical formulas, ready to use:

1. **Sales:** Linear projection of sales by units or amount.
2. **Sales with adjustment factors:** An advanced schedule that takes the previous year's sales and allows you to inject "One-off adjustments" (e.g., we lost a client) and "Growth factors" (e.g., raise prices by 15%).
3. **Production:** Automatically calculates how many units you must manufacture based on your projected sales, adding the desired ending inventory and subtracting the starting inventory you already have.
4. **Raw Material (RM) Purchases:** Derived from production, it calculates exactly how much material you must buy to avoid running out of stock.
5. **Labor and Overhead:** Cross-references the units to be produced with man-hours (Direct Labor) and fixed manufacturing overhead.
6. **Collections:** Separates the sale from the actual cash inflow through percentage breakdowns over time.
7. **Cash Flow:** The final destination. It measures Starting Balance, Inflows, Outflows, and yields the Ending Cash Balance.

## Planning the next year (Duplicate and Shift)

When December arrives, you don't need to rebuild all your templates and formulas for the upcoming year.

Cord includes the **Duplicate with Shift (`shiftYears`)** feature. By pressing "Duplicate for next year" on any schedule:
- The system will copy all rows, formulas, and inputs.
- It will automatically rename the periods (e.g., "Jan 2026" magically becomes "Jan 2027").
- It will keep cross-references to other schedules intact.

This ensures that your "Budget vs. Actual" module disconnects from the old year and starts comparing against the new year's actual data without breaking your financial model.
